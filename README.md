## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

EnableU utilizes a modern architecture centered around a robust **Python Flask** backend for core services, with a Node.js service available for specialized tasks.

For a deep dive into the system design, please see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd enableu
```

### 2. Backend (Python/Flask)
The core application logic resides here.
```bash
cd server_py
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure .env is configured (see server_py/README.md)
python app.py
```
*Runs on: `http://localhost:5001`*

### 3. Frontend (React/Vite)
Modern, accessible UI with 3D effects.
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
*Runs on: `http://localhost:5173`*

> **Note**: The Node.js backend (`server`) is available on port 5000 as a secondary service but is not required for the core application flow.
